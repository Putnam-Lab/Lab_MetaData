#Insert page number here - what is the correct minor tag to use? 
#Need to figure out how to have VSCode give us a drop down menu of the minor tags available 
#We found that if the minor tag is incorrect it will stay white while correct minor tags turn blue 

@Date 2020-11-06
#Recommend drop downs for format of date or an error that comes up if there is an issue with format
#Ask how QC/error detection works
#For dates maybe minor tags for YEAR, MONTH, DAY

#The minor tag Reef stays white and doesn't seem to be recognized?   
#We need GPS too 

#ReefCollection and CultureCollection should have Date in the name of the minor tag to avoid confusion and date should have a standard format (see note on Date above) 
#Potential problem: there may be multiple collection dates (e.g., collecting fragments on different dates during a culture/experiment)
#What about using Site or Origin as the major tag rather than species. Then you would say what species came from this site. 
#Also need country/reef/location/site as a major tag rather than within species. 
#Taxonomy within species rather than a separate major tag 
#Take home: Species doesn't make much sense logistically for a main tag - site would make more sense here 
#What do we do for cases where we have multiple reef collection/culture collection dates?
#Can we have multiple of the same minor tags? E.g., multiple dates. 
#Need to have sample type (fragment, biopsy, or based on size)
#Origin, culture, transplant tags maybe?  

@Method Sediment Trap
@Method-Type Sedimentation rates on the reef 
@Method-Note 
#Where would you put specifications or references for the methods that you are using? Do we include that? 

@Method CHN analysis
@Method-Type Algal Tissue Nitrogen
#What is method type? Do we need something about "measurement" or more specific minor tags? 
#Need a tag for where it was done if not in Notes 
#Maybe also a tag for equipment? 


@Code_Ref testing 
#Code_Ref questions - why is code ref white above? 
#What is the rule for listing packages or programs? What gets listed and what doesn't? 
#We think it should include things like: major packages and programs, versions, analysis-specific packages (like DESeq or WGCNA, but not ggplot etc) 
#Maybe Code Ref shoudl have a section of code for data type - e.g., 16S or RNA
#Minor tags for bioinformatics or Linux or R or Python? Like a Language category then add packages or software within that language 
#Where do we put design for packages like models, permanovas, DESeq2 - where is it appropriate to include these? 
##What is the best way to talk about the coding method? Whats the easiest structure - what is the best major tag? 

@Data_Ref 
#What gets referenced in this section? They reference every table, figure, and file - if we did that it would be many things. 
#When do we reference specific files and when can we reference the major github repo or files within the repo? 
#When do you need to add the size of the file? 
#For example having an entry for GitHub scripts/ data/ output/ figures/ ? 

#We need a complete list/key with all major and minor tags possible
